# Time-series-forecasting
Through this project, you can build time series and forecasting models. Once you have uploaded a dataset with historical values of the signal to be forecasted, the app trains a predictive model in a few clicks, along with several visualizations to help you evaluate its performance and get further insights.  The underlying model is built with Prophet, an open-source library developed by Facebook to forecast time series data.  Future additions include adding Neural Prophet and more options to tune the models.
